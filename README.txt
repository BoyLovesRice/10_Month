# Minimal GF Site

1) Put your video file in `assets/` and rename it to `our-video.mp4` (or change the src in `video.html`).
2) Open `letter.html` and paste your letter where indicated.
3) Open `index.html` in your browser to preview. Deploy anywhere (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

Files:
- index.html → landing
- video.html → video page (auto-redirects to letter when it ends)
- letter.html → the letter page
- styles.css → shared minimal styles
- assets/ → put your video here
