To my love,

Ten months. I’ve been thinking about how to even put this into words, because everything I feel for you is bigger than sentences, bigger than anything I could write on a page. But this is my best attempt... because you deserve to hear it. 

Being with you has been the most real, warm, and honest part of my life. You make every ordinary day feel like something I’ll remember. Even the small moments, our calls, sitting next to each other doing absolutely nothing, somehow become my favorite memories. You’ve changed me in ways I didn’t even realize I needed. You made me softer. You made me pay attention to the little things. You made me want to be someone who can be there for you, always. 

Thank you for loving me when I’m quiet. Thank you for loving me when I don’t know how to explain what I’m feeling. Thank you for always understanding me and for choosing me... every day. I love you. I love you in the way I take a deep breath around you and it feels like home. I love you in the way my day feels incomplete if I don’t hear your voice. I love you in the way I catch myself smiling just thinking about you. 

Ten months with you have been the best part of my life so far. To more mornings, more nights, more laughter, more everything. I want to keep choosing you, again and again. 

Always,
Josh
